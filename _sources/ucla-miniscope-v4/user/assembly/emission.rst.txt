    what does "CAREFUL NOT TO PROTRUDE INTO IT" mean?

#.  Screw the self-tapping screw into the hole in the emission module's side, and unscrew it. Performing this step early serves to provide accessibility to any burrs potentially introduced in the tapping process. It is easier to remove the burrs now than later in the emission module assembly process. If the self-tapping screw does not insert into the hole when initiating the screwing process, slightly open the hole gently with a scalpel. CAREFUL TO NOT PROTRUDE INTO IT.

#.  Inspect for burrs. If there are burrs, remove them. If they are not loose, use forceps or brush to remove them. If they are loose, blow with compressed air or gently tap the emission module against the work surface such that they fall out. Confirm that there are no burrs before proceeding. Such burrs interfere image formation and are more difficult to remove after the following steps are carried out

Insert Tube Lens
****************

..  warning::
    Be careful to not scratch lens in the following steps

#.  Position tube lens convex-down on lens tissue paper on work surface. Confirm the lens wobbles when laterally perturbed. Concentrically align the emission module's bore with the optical axis of the tube lens.

#.  Press emission module down and over tube lens until emission lens is flush with work surface. Gentle force is acceptable provided that the lens and emission module maintain parallel alignment through the pressing process

#.  Turn the emission module such that the inserted lens is facing up. Press on lens from the bottom using cloth or cotton swab so that the lens is flush with the emission module

Insert Dichroic Mirror
**********************

..  warning::
    Be careful to not scratch dichroic mirror in the following steps

#.  Correctly orient the dichroic mirror on lens tissue paper on work surface. You should be able to see the dichroic mirror's edge through its visible surface. Confirm this is true. This is the surface upon which incoming light is incident. If there is an arrow along the edge of the dichroic mirror, confirm the arrow points down

#.  With the less dominant hand, tilt the emission module such that the lens is facing the work surface and the diagonal slot which the dichroic mirror is supposed to be inserted is facing up. With the more dominant hand and forceps, insert the dichroic mirror into the diagonal slot of the emission module

#.  Inspect for burrs or visible debris in the emission module. If there is any, remove it similar to removing burrs before except now you can't use a brush or compressed air because that risks damaging the optics (compressed air sold specifically sold for optics this such as `CA4-US from THORLABS <https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=330&pn=CA4-US>`_ is acceptable, but be careful to blow it aimed at free air before blowing it aimed at optics)

**************************************************
Insert Half-Ball Lens and Attach Excitation Module
**************************************************

#.  With the less dominant hand, tilt the emission module such that the lens is facing the work surface and the cavity which the half-ball lens is supposed to be inserted is facing up. With the more dominant hand and forceps, insert the half-ball lens into the into the cavity. The spherical part of the lens should smoothly nest into the cavity

#.  Place the excitation module over the half-ball lens. Slowly fasten the excitation module with two screws to secure the half-ball lens and excitation module onto the emission module
