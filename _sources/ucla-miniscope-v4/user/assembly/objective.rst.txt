Objective Module
################

The 1st and second lenses in the objective module are numbered as indicated in the follow cross-sectional lens schematic:

    Cross-sectional schematic of tube lens/objective optical assembly [1]_

By default, the 1st and 2nd lenses are both 3mm diameter, 6mm focal length. However, you may desire to swap these to adjust working distance, magnification/field-of-view, spatial resolution, and effective NA. To learn more about this, refer to the :doc:`/ucla-miniscope-v4/developer/common-mods/lenses-combo` page. 

..  important:: If you are considering using a different lens combination, it is easier to reconfigure that now with an empty objective module (e.g. before following the instructions below) than later. 

..  warning::   Be careful to not scratch lenses.

Insert 1st Lens
***************

#.  Position first lens convex-up on lens tissue paper on work surface. Confirm the lens does not wobble when laterally perturbed. Concentrically align the objective module's bore with the optical axis of the first lens

#.  Press objective module down and over first lens until the objective module is flush with work surface. Gentle force is acceptable provided that the lens and objective module maintain parallel alignment through the pressing process

..  todo:: 
    should the following step occur before any lenses are inserted? what does without protruding mean?

#.  Pre-screw 3 screws on objective module without protruding

..  todo::
    more specific instructions in the following step?

#.  Clean bottom edge of lens with lens cloth

***************
Insert 2nd Lens
***************

#.  Insertion of the first lens sometimes introduces burrs. If those burrs are not loose, use forceps to remove them; do not scratch lens in this process. If those burrs are loose, gently tap the objective module against the work surface such that they fall out. Confirm that there are no burrs in the optical path before proceeding. Such burrs interfere image formation and are more difficult to remove after the following steps are carried out.

#.  Position second lens convex-up on lens tissue paper on work surface. Confirm the lens does not wobble when laterally perturbed. Concentrically align the objective module's bore with the optical axis of the second lens

#.  Press objective module down and over second lens until the objective module is flush with work surface. Gentle force is acceptable provided that the lens and objective module maintain parallel alignment through the pressing process
