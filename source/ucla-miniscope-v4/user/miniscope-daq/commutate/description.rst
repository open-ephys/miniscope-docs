*   The ``Quaternion`` node connects to the ``AutoCommutator`` node. The ``AutoCommutator`` node represents a ``IncludeWorkflow`` operator named *AutoCommutator*. An ``IncludeWorkflow`` operator includes a workflow from another file into a parent workflow. To inspect the included workflow, press F12 while the ``AutoCommutator`` node is selected. This workflow comes from the OpenEphys.Commutator Bonsai package.
