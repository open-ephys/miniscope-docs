Preparation
***********

#.  If your UCLA Miniscope v4 PCB has tabs on the ETL/EWL rings, cut those tabs off

Fasten the Excitation Module to the PCB
***************************************

..  todo::
    what screws?

#.  Insert two ____ screws for fastening the PCB to the excitation module into the two holes that are located on the LED/EWL flap of the PCB

**************************************************
Fasten the EWL/ETL and Objective Module to the PCB
**************************************************

#.  Orient EWL/ETL on work surface. Ridge faces up.

#.  Bend the flex-PCB circles. Do not press hard; just gently shape them

#.  Place PCB on objective module

#.  Four finger grip. Index and middle holding emission module, thumb and ring finger holding objective module.

#.  Put EWL in between PCB circles.

#.  Start screwing 3 screws of objective module.

#.  Finish screwing 3 screws of objective module.

#.  Check PCB circles fit around EWL and within objective module.

#.  Check for burrs in top pocket and remove with compressed air

#.  Paint filter sides with permanent marker

#.  Check filter orientation. Arrow pointing down. DO NOT SCRATCH FILTER

#.  Place filter into emission module top pocket.

#.  Remove sensor protective film

#.  Fit PCB sensor onto emission module to close the scope.

#.  Screw both PCB flaps down with 2 screws by placing the screw in the flap hole first and then screwing them into the body so they donâ€™t end up between the modules
