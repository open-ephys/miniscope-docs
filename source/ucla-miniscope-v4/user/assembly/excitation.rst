..  warning::
    Be careful to not scratch filter in the following steps

#.  Correctly orient filter on lens tissue paper on work surface. You should be able to see the filter's edge through its visible surface. Confirm this is true. This is the surface upon which incoming light is incident. If there is an arrow along the edge of the filter, confirm the arrow points down before proceeding

#.  Position the excitation module upright such that the filter can be inserted. Place the filter onto the excitation module where it is supposed to be inserted. Maintain the filter's orientation during this process. If the orientation is lost, return to the previous step before proceeding
