This is the recommended timeline for a standard UCLA Miniscope v4 surgery in a mouse.

Imaging neural activity with the UCLA Miniscope v4 requires that cells in the regions of interest are loaded with fluorescent CA\ :sup:`2+` indicators. This is primarily accomplished through viral injection. GRIN lenses are necessary for experiments studying deeper regions of the brain. If viral injection and GRIN lens implantation are both to be performed, it is easier to inject before implanting. Three weeks of mouse recovery are recommended after GRIN lens implantation. After recovery, the mouse can be baseplated. The baseplate provides a structural mount for the UCLA Miniscope v4 so that the user can reliably register the miniscope into the same position relative to the brain. Two weeks of habituation after baseplating is recommended. The UCLA Miniscope v4 enables several weeks to months of in-vivo imaging and freely-moving behavior after this step. 

For habituation, a UCLA Miniscope v4 Dummy Scope (`store <https://open-ephys.org/miniscope-v4/miniscope-v4-dummy-scope>`__, `GitHub <https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4/blob/master/Miniscope-v4-Body-Parts/Parts%20v4_2/Miniscope_v4_Dummy.step>`__) is recommended.

Open Ephys does not currently provide support for surgeries. As a starting point for developing a surgical protocol for your own experiment, refer to the 2021 Miniscope Workshop video `Grin Lens & Baseplate Surgery <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZPAQps_uVo>`_ about implanting and baseplating a mouse for imaging its CA1 with the UCLA Miniscope v4 by Susie Feng from the Shuman lab.

Necessary Equipment for Miniscope Assembly
******************************************

It is recommended to have this equipment for assembling or servicing the UCLA Miniscope v4: 

*   ESD gloves (to safely handle the PCB and maintain cleanliness of optics)

*   Lens cloth or lens tissue (to maintain cleanliness of optics)

*   Compressed air spray (to maintain cleanliness of optics)

*   Fine tweezers/forceps 

*   Torx T2 screwdriver 

*   Scalpel/biopsy punch

*   Adhesive (`Overview of adhesive for UCLA Miniscope v4 assembly <https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4/wiki/Parts-List#glueepoxy>`__)

Below is a visualization of the equipment that can be used to assemble and service the UCLA Miniscope v4:

Last, confirm that you have compatible data acquisition hardware. If you don't, acquire the compatible data acquisition hardware.

.. Necessary Equipment for Operating the Miniscope
.. ***********************************************

..  A 0.035" hex screwdriver is necessary for setting or unsetting the miniscope against the baseplate. 

.. todo:: confirm hex size. what other equipment for operating miniscope?

..  Spare tethers are recommended to be able to continue experiments with minimal interruptions in the case of a broken tether.
