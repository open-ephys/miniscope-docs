To faciltate data-acquisition according to your timeline, this section of the documentation outlines the required tools and prepatory steps necessary to assemble/operate the UCLA Miniscope v4 and acquire data with it.

Surgery Timeline

This is the recommended timeline for a standard UCLA Miniscope v4 surgery.

Imaging neural activity with the UCLA Miniscope v4 requires that Calcium-binding flourescent indicators are present in the regions of interest. If your experimental subject does not already express such indicators, a viral injection is likely the best way to introduce them. Moreover, many experiments require a GRIN lens to image the deeper regions of the brain that are commonly studied. These processes subsequently require that the mouse is allowed to recover for three weeks. The baseplate provides a structural mount for the UCLA Miniscope v4 such that it reliably registers into the same position relative to the mouse brain. Two weeks of habituation to the UCLA Miniscope v4 are recommended after baseplating. After habituation, the UCLA Miniscope v4 enables several weeks to months of in-vivo imaging and freely-moving behavior.

Necessary Equipment
*******************

Additionally, you must procure the equipment necessary to assemble and operate the UCLA Miniscope v4:

*   ESD gloves (to safely handle the PCB and maintain cleanliness of optics)

*   Lens cloth or lens tissue (to maintain cleanliness of optics)

*   Compressed air spray (to maintain cleanliness of optics)

*   Fine tweezers/forceps 

*   Torx T2 screwdriver 

*   Scalpel/biopsy punch

*   Adhesive (`Overview of adhesive for UCLA Miniscope v4 assembly <https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4/wiki/Parts-List#glueepoxy>`__)

Below demonstrates examples of equipment that can be used to assemble and operate the UCLA Miniscope v4:
