Modifications that are commonly performed by scientists to adapt the UCLA miniscope v4(s) to their respective experiment include: 

*   :doc:`Modifying the lens configuration </ucla-miniscope-v4/developer/common-mods/lenses-combo>` to adjust magnification/field-of-view and working distance, spatial resolution, and effective NA (emission light collection efficiency)

*   :doc:`Modifying the LED/dichroic mirror/filters combination </ucla-miniscope-v4/developer/common-mods/led-filters-dichroic-combo>` to image calcium indicators that excite and/or emit bands of light that are not compatible with the UCLA Miniscope v4's standard LED/dichroic mirror/filters configuration 

..  *   :doc:`Modifying the current-limiting resistor for LED excitation light source </ucla-miniscope-v4/developer/common-mods/led-resistor>` to change the dynamic range of the UCLA Miniscope v4's LED excitation to change the dynamic range of the LED excitation light source to a more useful range for their experiment
