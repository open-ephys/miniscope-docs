The developer guide is intended to acquaint the user with the miniscope's underpinnings as well as help users find design and production files.

All the design and production files for the UCLA Miniscope v4 PCB are available for download in the UCLA Miniscope v4's official GitHub repository: https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4. To learn more about the design, navigate to one of the following pages:

*   :doc:`/ucla-miniscope-v4/developer/optomechanical`

*   :doc:`/ucla-miniscope-v4/developer/electrical`

The developer guide also contains information about :doc:`/ucla-miniscope-v4/developer/mods/index` to configure the UCLA Minisope v4 for your experiment.
